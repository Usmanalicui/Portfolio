##### **Creating Array using numpy**

###### **1d array**

  **- Create 1D array  



 	  - Type of array 

	- Find length of array 

	 - indexing (specific, index, goes through one to all) 

	 - Create arrays that consists of zero 

	 - Create Arrays with one 

	 - Create Arrays with empty 

	 - Assignment diff between empty and ones 

	 - Make through Range 

	 - Specify range 

	 - Specific range with specific interval aka gap 

	 - Assignment table of 6 through interval 

	 - Use line space and tell whats use is it for 

	 - Specify data types and make an array of specific data types**   





###### **Array Functions**

  **- Make whole array of int into decimal just putting one val in it**

 **- Sorting asc and des both order 

	 - concatenate two arrays 

	 - sort again**   





###### **2-D Arrays**

   **- Make a 2-D Array 

	 - Concatenate two arrays 

	 - Make an error and Find error, also give reasoning of it 

	 - Change axis of the concatenate make vertical then horizontal i mean in merging 

	 - Find number of dimensions in an array 

	 - Find Number of elements in an array 

	 - Find its shape 

	 - reshape the Array 

	 - Use order with reshape 

	 - conver 1d into 2d array 

	 - row wise and column wise making 2D arrays 

	 - slicing arrays 

	 - Multiply Whole array with 6 and add whole array with 6 also get sum of whole array**
