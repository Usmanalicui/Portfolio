Divide the data set into two categories
Find most selling category on the bases of events and normality
group them also
add both of em and then look again and compare
look how many values have been gone left and right cancelled and completed and all
Find reasons for everythin that happened, Research try to find more datasets related to it asap
Remove most selling categories again from the graph then look again and see what happens with it 
if it works out hten start analyizing them

other wise start working on other things and do count them  in the same project
make correlation heat map for the categories and the type of payment method used
